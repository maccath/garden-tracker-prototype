# Garden Tracker

A prototype garden tracking app built using AngularJS.

It displays a list of plants and their current statuses, as well as statistics, logs and notes.

Data is hard-coded and does not persist.

## Demo

A working demo of the app has been deployed to GitHub pages and can be found at https://maccath.github.io/garden-tracker-prototype/
